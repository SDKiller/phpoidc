phpOIDC Project
===============

About phpOIDC
-------------

This is an open source implementation of OpenID Connect in PHP by Nomura Research Institute, Ltd. This project was partly funded by the PEOFIAMP project sponsored by the Ministry of internal affairs and communication of Japan as a part of EU-Japan cooperation funding and is offered as the result of the project. 

This implementation has been tested for interoperability at series of interop and has shown to be one of the most compliant implementation. However, as the focus was on the interoperability, less focus was given to the security issues around the implementation. Reviewers are kindly requested to submit any issues.
